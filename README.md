# Quick Chain

**Quick Chain** is a high-performance blockchain designed for **fast block production** and can be used as a **distributed database**.  
It provides low-latency consensus, flexible data storage, and scalable architecture suitable for both financial and non-financial applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Fast Block Production** — sub-second block times, optimized for low-latency use cases.
- 📦 **Distributed Database** — store structured or unstructured data on-chain with high availability.
- 🔒 **Secure Consensus** — Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus ensuring data consistency across nodes.
- 🌐 **Scalable Network** — horizontally scalable node architecture.
- 🔧 **Developer Friendly** — gRPC/REST APIs, SDKs, and CLI tools for easy integration.
